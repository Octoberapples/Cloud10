# Cloud10
Cloud project autumn 2016

## TODO 
- [X] REST API (Flask) 
- [X] HEAT Template 
- [X] A file with the three tasks (GENERATE MESH, CONVERTER and CALCULATOR)
- [X] Swift, needs to be able to upload and download the Gmsh-meshes, download Gmsh-meshes and upload and download the XML meshes
- [X] Celery-Master (starts celery tasks (possibly chains them))  
- [ ] Create a graph over the result <Paste>

##THE DIFFERENT PARTS

###REST API
**INPUT**:  <br />
angle_start : smallest anglemof attack (degrees)  <br />
angle_stop  : biggest angle of attack (degrees)  <br />
n_angles    : split angle_stop-angle_start into n_angles parts  <br />
n_nodes     : number of nodes on one side of airfoil  <br />
n_levels : number of refinement steps in meshing 0=no refinement 1=one time 2=two times etc...  <br />

* Starting process
* Fetching process
* Status of a process

**OUTPUT**: <br />
Parameters  


###MASTER
**INPUT:** <br />
Parameters <br />

**OUTPUT:** <br />
Parameters to GENERATE MESH celery worker

* Start everything
* Link together tasks

###Celery process GENERATE MESH 
This process is going to generate several different meshes by using Gmsh then store the result in Swift. 

* Send parameters to Gmsh and upload the result to Swift
* Potential authorisation 

###Celery process CONVERTER
This celery process gets mesh (the data) from Swift. This process uses dolfin-convert to convert the meshes into Dolfins XML and then stores it in Swift.  <br />


* Download Gmsh-mesh from Swift 
* Convert to Dolfin XML by using a dolfin-converter (ships with FEniCS)
* Upload Dolfin XML to Swift
* Potential authorisation

###Celery process CALCULATOR 
This celery process gets the dolfin XML with the mesh data and runs this through airfoil (the calculator). 


* Download Dolfin XML from Swift
* Use Airfoil to calculate
* For each angle file generated by Airfoil, take the mean of the values of “Drag” and “Lift” ( In order to calculate mean, skip some initial values as algorithm needs some time to stabilised. For example, if there are 100 values in the file, skip the first 30 values and than take the mean). 

###RESULT
* Should contain a graph over the mean drag and lift values, the angle with the highest value of lift is the most optimal angle

### Worker dependencies
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics-1.6.x 
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install libdolfin1.6 gmsh python-pip
sudo pip install numpy
```
